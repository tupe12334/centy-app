# Custom states

When a project has custom states in the `config.json` file in the `allowedStates` prop we want to see them in the state selector, make the logic of getting the state to be a class that all over when getting the states options use this class as the single source of truth about the issues states options

Before implementing this issue please map all the locations relevant for the states.

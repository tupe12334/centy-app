# Cloudflare Pages redirects for SPA-style routing
# This ensures all routes that don't match static files are served by the catch-all page
# The catch-all page handles client-side routing based on the actual URL

# Serve static assets directly (let Cloudflare handle these)
/_next/*  /_next/:splat  200

# All other routes that don't match static files should serve the fallback page
# The 200 status means "rewrite" (serve the content but keep the original URL)
/*  /_fallback/index.html  200
